# Fantasy Premier League Analysis

## What is it?
Values of FPL players for season 2022-23 have been scraped using the FPL API. The data will be used to create further analysis and visualisations.

---
## Things to do next?
- [ ] Get players ID matched with understat or fbref player ID
- [ ] After players ID getting matched, use the xG and xgA data of the players to make an analysis of how a player has been performing in the last few weeks.
- [ ] Create a visualisation to show the performance of the players in the last few weeks.
